<h1> <u>Anime Lovers</u> </h1>
<p><strong>This website is about the different types of anime that are very popular and very familiar with a lot of people. For example there's fruits basket, dragon ball z, one peice and so much more. One of my favorite animes that I like to watch is tokyo ghoul. It's about a man who falls in love with a young lady not knowing who she is. They was alone in an alley one night and lets just say he saw the real her. She was a monster or should I say a ghoul who only fed off of human flesh. Long story short, she ends up biting him not eating him all the way because he pushes off and runs. She ends up dying because she gets hit by a big object and he turns half ghoul. This anime is very interesting and I suggest you get started on watching it.
